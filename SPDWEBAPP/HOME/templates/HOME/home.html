                <b>Success</b> <br>
                Sigma Phi Delta prides itself on their consistent academic success.
                Each semester, their chapter GPA is well above the all-male engineering average,
                and they consistently rank well against other fraternity houses on campus. 
                <br>
                <b>Assistance</b> <br>
                In order to ensure all of their active members and new members are held to the same
                standard, each member is assigned an academic mentor in the same degree program.
                They are also required to attend weekly study tables where they are surrounded by
                an abundance of knowledge and resources in order to help them succeed. 
                <br>
                <b>Opportunity</b> <br>
                In the interest of giving their members as many opportunities as possible for them
                to further their academic and professional careers, they frequently have professors,
                industry professionals, and employers present at their weekly chapter meetings.

                You truly aren't experiencing college if your only friends are your textbooks.
                Sigma Phi Delta members are anything but the "typical" engineer. While they take the same classes,
                help each other out with homework, and study together, they also know how to have a good time after the hard work is finished!
                Sigma Phi Delta members regularly participate in formals, tailgates, socials, float trips, cook outs, and intramural sports.
