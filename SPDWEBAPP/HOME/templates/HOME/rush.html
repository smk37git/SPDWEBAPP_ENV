        <h3 class="rush-heading">About Us</h3>
        <p>
            The Beta-Omicron Chapter of Sigma Phi Delta is the premiere social and professional
            Engineering fraternity at the University of Missouri. Our closely-knit brotherhood is
            committed to developing strong professional skills and relationships for their future
            careers, encouraging positive social skills to aid in their personal endeavors, fostering
            scholastic success in their academic pursuits, and promoting the development of life-long friendships. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="rush-heading">Professional</h3>
        <p>
            One in three Sigma Phi Delta members participate in co-ops, internships, and study abroad opportunities.
            Sigma Phi Delta is dedicated to helping their brothers to secure similar opportunities both during and
            after their college experience. Sigma Phi Delta also regularly hosts professional speakers,
            resume reviews, and other professional development events for their members. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="rush-heading">Philanthropy</h3>
        <p>
            Sigma Phi Delta recognizes the importance of giving back to their community.
            They are dedicated to volunteering their time at local non-profit organizations
            and benefiting their national philanthropy FIRST©. Some of their frequent contributions
            include The Food Bank for Central & Northeast Missouri, Ronald McDonald House, RAMS, and Adopt-A-Spot. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="rush-heading">Academic</h3>
        <p>
            Sigma Phi Delta prides itself on their consistent academic success.
            Each semester, their chapter GPA is well above the all-male engineering average,
            and they consistently rank well against other fraternity houses on campus. 

            In the interest of giving their members as many opportunities as possible for them
            to further their academic and professional careers, they frequently have professors,
            industry professionals, and employers present at their weekly chapter meetings. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="rush-heading">Social</h3>
        <p>
            You truly aren't experiencing college if your only friends are your textbooks.
            Sigma Phi Delta members are anything but the "typical" engineer. While they take the same classes,
            help each other out with homework, and study together, they also know how to have a good time after the hard work is finished!
            Sigma Phi Delta members regularly participate in formals, tailgates, socials, float trips, cook outs, and intramural sports.
